A mini web app that simulates the infamous enigma machine, made entirely in React.JS

### How to use:

1) Click anywhere on the site to get the machine started
2) Set up the rollers
3) Start punching in your encrypted code or the message you want to encrypt on your keyboard
4) Note down the decoded/encoded characters as they light up
5) Voila you have achieved an encryption that has 158,962,555,217,826,360,000 alternate settings
